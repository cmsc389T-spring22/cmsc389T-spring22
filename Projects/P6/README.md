# Project 6 Base Image

The files included in this directory allow you to create a docker image with python and twilio preinstalled. You should put this in the root of your repository and rebuild the image if you edit your hooks file.Â 

You can create a container by running

```
docker build -t project6 .
```

When you want to connect to this container, just run

```
docker run -it project6 bash
```

Once you are inside the container, you can test your hook by doing a quick test commit. An example is provided below:

```
touch test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test hook"
```
